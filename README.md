# Fastag-Fraud-Detection

**Aim:** This project aims to develop a machine learning classification approach-based trustworthy fraud detection solution for Fastag transactions. Transaction amounts, car details, location, and geographic information are among the dataset's most important characteristics. Building a robust model with dependable fraud detection capabilities is necessary to guarantee the security and integrity of Fastag transactions.

**Domain Prerequisite Learning:** Fastag is an electronic toll collection system introduced in India to streamline the process of toll collection on highways and expressways. Its primary purpose is to enable vehicles to pass through toll booths seamlessly without the need for cash transactions or manual intervention. Fastag operates on the basis of Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology, where a small sticker containing an RFID chip and antenna is affixed to the vehicle's windshield. This sticker is linked to a prepaid account, allowing toll charges to be deducted automatically as the vehicle passes through a Fastag-enabled toll booth.
The functionality of Fastag revolves around its ability to communicate wirelessly with toll booth infrastructure, allowing for quick and efficient toll collection. As a vehicle approaches a toll booth, the Fastag sticker is detected by RFID readers installed overhead, which then communicate with backend systems to deduct the appropriate toll amount from the linked prepaid account. This process occurs in a matter of seconds, enabling vehicles to proceed without stopping, thus reducing congestion and enhancing overall traffic flow.
The widespread adoption of Fastag across India has led to significant improvements in toll collection efficiency and traffic management. With millions of vehicles equipped with Fastag stickers, toll booths experience reduced wait times and congestion, leading to smoother traffic flow on highways and expressways. Additionally, Fastag promotes digital transactions and reduces the reliance on cash, contributing to the government's efforts to promote a cashless economy. Overall, Fastag plays a vital role in modernizing toll collection infrastructure, improving road travel experiences, and enhancing transportation efficiency nationwide. However, like any digital system, Fastag is susceptible to fraudulent activities, necessitating robust fraud detection mechanisms. Here's a domain prerequisite learning guide for Fastag fraud detection.
